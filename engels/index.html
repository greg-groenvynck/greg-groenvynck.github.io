<h1 >Review of a network tool</h1>

<p><strong>Case study: Engels</strong></p>

<h2>VPN: good or bad? Safe or Unsafe?</h2>

<ul>
  I’m writing my review about VPN (Virtual Private Networking). It’s a way of connecting two computers over a wide network. VPN is a cheaper way of connecting 2 computers while WAN (Wide Area Network) is more expensive.
</ul>

<ul>
The process of this VPN goes like this: first a computer is connected to the internet so that it can broadcast a signal through the internet to a program that is located on a host (where the host is a PC or server or online software). Next the software creates (by using an OS or a virtual sheet over the OS that is already on the PC) a connection back to the original PC so the first PC can take over the other PC. Mostly there is also a firewall between the server and the PC so that hackers can’t get in that easy. Sometimes (like I said) people use virtual sheets and they do that because they want to use as few mb/s as possible so that it becomes even cheaper. The thing is that when there is a virtual sheet there doesn’t need to be a refresh rate of 60 frames per second but more like 10fps.
Thanks to the recent growth of internet not only will VPN be more common but it will only lower the price of such one VPN. Like I said before it’s not super cheap because of the firewall expenses you’ll have to pay but once it’s up it will only make your wallet feel better.
Main reason of firewalls is that in VPNs people connect 2 computers with each other which attracts hackers because with the right software people can take over a PC.
The next thing about VPN is something my company I worked at had. It was a MaTMa. MaTMa technology links your machines together via a wireless connection between an industrial modem and a server. This communication is done through a special MaTMa SIM card.
</ul>

<h2 >Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am impressed by the fact that it is so cheap.</li>
<li>A big plus is that you can use it to work from home.</li>
<li>But the best thing is that you can keep an eye on your coworkers (as a boss) to see if they do their job right.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li>a disadvantage is that you have to spend that extra money to insert firewalls and such security measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 >Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
  VPN is a must if people actually need it. Don’t use it if you don’t know anything about it. It can be dangerous however, it can also be very useful for some people.
</ul>

                <p>I am Greg Groenvynck, I’m 18 years old and I go to Immaculata Instituut in Oostmalle. Right now I am studying IT-management.</p>

                <p>I first started getting into IT when I was about 10 years old and when my old PC stopped working. I asked an older friend (he was about 15 at that moment and had started studying IT-management) to help fixing the PC. As he started fixing my pc, I got fascinated by how he was fixing it. Then I started looking up information by watching tutorials about software and hardware on YouTube.</p>

                <p>Right now I don’t really have any future prospects because I am still trying to figure out what my goal is going to be. Am I going to be a Software developer or am I going to start a company I don’t know YET! I don’t know what the future holds for me but I do know it’s going to be something in IT and I hope not just a standard job.</p>

                <p>Me and my pc are very close (the PC I have built myself) because it taught me certain things I would never learn in class like how to fix malware or virus attacks. It also showed me to be careful with certain things I should watch out for, for example rechecking if I bought the right processor or the right motherboard. IT has become a very important part of my life because it showed me that a pc isn’t just for gaming or for watching videos…</p>
